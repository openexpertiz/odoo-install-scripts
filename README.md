# odoo-install-scripts
Automated install scripts for Odoo + Clouder /!\ BETA version, do NOT use in production!
This scripts just needs to be preconfigured before being launched, no interaction needed. 

The script is based on the install scripts from André Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts), Yenthe (https://github.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript), Gustavo Valverde (https://github.com/gustavovalverde/odoo-install-scripts) with some additions from Nils Hamerlinck (http://nils.hamerlinck.fr/blog/2015/04/09/install-odoo-vps-ubuntu/)

It also follows the approach recommended in Odoo's documentation (https://www.odoo.com/documentation/9.0/setup/install.html) using pip instead of apt-get for python dependencies
